            Why a daily planner?

            With all the technology in today's society and the pace of
            life speeding up at exponential rates, everyone could use a daily planner. Some people can keep everyting organized in their head, but wouldn't you rather not have to constantly think about everything your day consists of 
            and be able to focus more intently on whatever it is you are doing at the moment?
